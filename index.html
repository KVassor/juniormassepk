<h1>Bio</h1>
<p style="width: 50%;margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">Junior Mass was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, and gives an ode to his state through the “Mass” portion of his artist name. He feels what he’s doing is bigger than his city and he’s putting on for the whole state of Massachusetts. Junior mass started his path in the music industry as a producer and investor in other artists, however, the vision he had could only be presented through himself. Junior took artistry into his own hands and began making music, in order to express himself and tell his story. From a young age, he has been surrounded by music his father had a studio in the basement along with a drumset and other instruments. His love for music started as a child and has developed into his career and persona. When it comes to the lyrical content and sound of his music, Junior Mass is fully authentic and does not limit himself creatively whatsoever. He speaks on the past, present, and plans for the future regarding things he has seen and experienced. Junior is both talented in freestyling and writing, depending on the vibe and what he’s feeling will determine how he creates in the studio. His sound is unique and he’s looking for beats that will make you feel the lyrics whether he’s focused on the delivery of his rap or experimenting with melodies, his product will draw emotion and deliver a message. Music is his passion and he is driven towards opening up his city and help others find their creative platform alongside himself.
